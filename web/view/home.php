  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>There are over 13,000 school districts in the United States.  Almost every school district has an associated non-profit wing, often refered to as the district's "Education Foundation". While education foundations vary in their roles and activities, most are responsible for overseeing fundraising, community partnerships, and philanthropic activities on behalf of the school district. This can include providing scholarships to students, providing grants to teachers, and hosting fundraising events including golf tournaments, galas, and donation drives.</p> 
    <p>Foundationful is a directory tool for collecting information about education foundations and the programs that they sponsor.</p>
